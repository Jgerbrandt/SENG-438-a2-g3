# 1 Introduction

    Within this lab, our team worked together to develop tests on the provided systems. This exercise was an example of blackbox testing, as the source code of the system under test was not revealed to us. Therefore, it was required that design documents for the classes under test to be analyzed, with methods from these documents chosen for testing. Tests were developed with junit and were able to successfully test basic functionality as well as boundary cases of the system.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Over this lab, the team worked collaboratively in order to successfully complete the assignment. All group members were responsible for an equal share of work and completed their portions on time. Jesse and Aaron managed the mock tests while Ethan and Avi managed the tests for Range. The entire team collaborated on the lab document. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Getting started on using Eclipse was a challenge within this lab, especially with the lab instructions being on an outdated version of Eclipse. Additionally, none of the team had much experience with Eclipse, so learning a new program added additional problems to the assignment.
